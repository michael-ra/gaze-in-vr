# Gaze In VR
#### In this summary we give an overview how Gaze in VR is being currently used, and what the state of research on it currently is. 

With the increasing use of virtual reality (VR) technologies in research and consumer
environments, another application of VR arises for scientific research. 

One use of applying VR is to capture the gaze of a participant, which provides information about their focus in
a given scenario or scientific study. The gaze direction of the participant provides valuable
information and momentary snapshots about the focus of attention and can be evaluated
accordingly for social studies.

In this literature review, we are proposing gaze as an important factor for the research
field of social interaction, which can significantly improve the social experience in VR
both directly or indirectly. 

This can lead to an enhanced VR experience that feels real to
the end user. This literature review aims to give a brief overview about the topic of gaze
in VR and what the current state of research is in selected scientific literature.
